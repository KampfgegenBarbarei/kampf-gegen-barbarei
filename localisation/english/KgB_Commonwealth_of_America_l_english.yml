    CSA_the_echos_of_war_1:0 "The Echos of War"
    CSA_the_echos_of_war_1_desc:0 "The flames of civil war have ended and North America has been united beneath the red flag of syndicalism, but still a scar remains. The echos of war still ring through the nation, with untold millions dead buried in graves thousands of miles from their omes, famine sweeping the nation, and violence prevaling throughout the former Longist and Federal territories the wounds of civil war are far from healed. Although under the watchful eyes of the revolution's mother Elizibeth Gurney Flynn reconstruction has grudged onwards the job is far from done, and much work lies ahead for every fellow worker in the Commonwealth of America."
    CSA_the_pacific_states_1:0 "The Pacific States"
    CSA_the_pacific_states_1_desc:0 "Although the civil war was won through military victory, the nation wasn't unified this way. After the fall of the Longists, Federalists, and Canadians the Farmer-Labor leadership in the Pacific States voted to join with the Combined Syndicates in 1941 and together form the Commonwealth of America. This however has not come without cost and now the nation still stands divided. Although the council system governs much of the nation inside the former Pacific State's territory a seperate 'moderate' system rules and this system works almost entirly outside of the rest of the Commonwealth creating a division that left unchecked could tear the whole Commonwealth apart."
