 GER_totalist_party: "DOI"
 GER_totalist_party_long: "Deutsche Organisation der Internationale/German Organisation of the Internationale"
 GER_syndicalist_party: "FVdG"
 GER_syndicalist_party_long: "Freie Vereinigung deutscher Gewerkschaften/Free Association of German Trade Unions\n§gThe FVdG (Free Association of German Trade Unions) was founded in 1897 as an umbrella organisations for free trade unions. After being dismissed by the SPD for being to radical in 1907, the trade union representatives of the FVdG decided to look to France where the CGT just adopted the anarcho-syndicalist Charter of Amiens. At the first international syndicalist congress in London in 1913, Fritz Kater, a leading member, was elected to be the president of the congress. During the Weltkrieg the FVdG strongly opposed the Burgfriedenspolitik of the SPD and openly agitated against the war.§! "
 GER_radical_socialist_party: "USPD"
 GER_radical_socialist_party_long: "Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands/Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany"
 GER_social_democrat_party: "SPD"
 GER_social_democrat_party_long: "Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\n§gWith its first predecessor being founded in 1863, the SPD (Social Democratic Party Germany) is one of the oldest parties in Germany, and one of the most popular left-wing parties in Europe. The SPD was regularly fought by the conservative establishment, with the two most important ones being the suppression of the SPD under Bismarck and later Ludendorff. Before the First World War, the SPD was the strongest party in the Reichstag. During the War, however, the SPD split in two; the moderate MSPD and the more radical anti-war USPD. After a failed peaceful revolution in September 1918, both parties once more reconciled and reunited under the banner of the SPD. The SPD was the most vocal opponent of the Ludendorff dictatorship and the target of many government-instructed sanctions.\n\nSPD representatives were present at the dismissal of the dictator and many people within the Empire attribute the fall of the dictatorship to them. Under Germany’s "second-greatest" chancellor, Alfred von Tirpitz, the SPD also has had to struggle against increasing levels of wealth among workers leading to decreased electoral output even in former core territories. The SPD's voter block is mostly among the lower classes and the industrial areas along the Rhine in the Kingdom of Saxony and in cities in Silesia, but Elsaß-Lothringen is also proving to be a hotbed of German social democracy, especially after the decline of the Zentrum and the ongoing centralisation efforts of the government.§!"
 GER_social_liberal_party: "FVP"
 GER_social_liberal_party_long: "Fortschrittliche Volkspartei\n§gCreated in 1910, the FVP (Progressive People's Party) is the social liberal alternative to the NLP. The FVP was a staunch opponent of the Ludendorff dictatorship, supporting political liberalisation and electoral reform. Thanks to the FVP's strong support among liberal civil servants, the FVP managed to become the largest bourgeois opposition party after the 1923 elections – but wasn't able to capitalise on this success properly. The party lost many seats in the disastrous elections of 1928 and 1932, with many going to the SPD. The FVP is currently lead by its left-wing wing lead by Anton Erkelenz, being supportive of a number of socially liberal reforms, like voting rights for women, strong economic intervention, et cetera.§!"
 GER_market_liberal_party: "NLP"
 GER_market_liberal_party_long: "Nationalliberale Partei\n§gCreated in 1866, the NLP began as the most prominent German party, becoming a main backer of the Bismarck chancellorship. However, after Bismarck's turn to the right, the party's influence has been continuously waning. The NLP was mainly powerless in the Reichstag during the Weltkrieg, though cooperating with the left-wing parties at times. When the DVLP was created, some thought the NLP would get usurped by them, but Stresemann was able to keep the NLP independent, with him leading the NLP to be neutral on the Ludendorff dictatorship.\n\nAfter Ludendorff's fall and the rise of Tirpitz, the NLP joined Tirpitz's great coalition, with it supporting German colonialism, expansion of the military, and liberal economic policies in the government. Stresemann was able to make the NLP flourish, thus his death in 1929 strongly weakened the NLP. Dingeldey led the NLP in its worst election result ever, causing his resignation, and him unable to give the NLP a position in the government. Dingeldey was replaced by Reichsbankpräsident Hjalmar Schacht as leader, with Julius Curtius being the chancellor candidate of the NLP. The NLP has strong support among industry giants and the more well-off, though some of them have been moving away from the NLP, looking for a new champion of their interests.§!"
 GER_social_conservative_party: "Zentrum"
 GER_social_conservative_party_long: "Zentrumspartei\n§gCreated in 1870, the Zentrum (Centre) has always represented the interests of German Catholics. The party was the main enemy of Bismarck during the Kulturkampf, with it later becoming more and more integrated into day-to-day ruling. The Zentrum was a main architect of the Reichstag’s Peace Resolution of 1917, under the guise of the leader of the parliamentary faction, Matthias Erzberger. The Zentrum was opposed to the Ludendorff dictatorships, though it refrained from supporting protests. The party tried to widen its appeal in 1923, however, this failed massively, causing the rise of the centrist Wilhelm Marx, but he too was unable to turn the fortunes of the party, with the Zentrum losing another election in 1932.\n\nWith both the leftists and centrists within the party discredited, the right-wing under the leadership of Franz von Papen took over, pursuing a unitarian vision, which caused many defections from the party, with him also causing the left-wing of the party to jump ship and form the CSRP. The party is strongly aligned to the DkP, however there Heinrich Brüning is leading the opposition towards von Papen's leadership, wanting a return to the original federalist elements of the Zentrum, with him also wishing to reunite the Zentrum with its splinter parties.§!"
 GER_paternal_autocrat_party: "DRP"
 GER_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Deutsche Reichspartei\n§gFounded in 1866, the DRP (German Imperial Party) is a liberal-conservative party in the German Empire. For most of its existence, the DRP tried to act as a compromiser between NLP and DRP, however, with the beginning of the 20th century, it began drawing closer to the DkP. It opposed the democratic alliance of SPD, FVP, and Zentrum in the Reichstag together with the DkP during the First World War. The party was a silent supporter of the Ludendorff dictatorship, with it becoming the smallest member of the Great Coalition of von Tirpitz. The party is a strong supporter of colonialism and fleet expansion while opposing electoral reform in Prussia strongly. The DRP has been seeing a slight resurgence since the death of the Tirpitz and the subsequent collapse of the DVLP as a political heavy-weight.§!"
 GER_authoritarian_democrat_party: "DkP"
 GER_SCH_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Kamarilla"
 GER_SCH_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Schleicher's Kamarilla\n§gThe kamarilla around Kurt von Schleicher is a clique of military officers aligned to him, with them being united around their support to Schleicher; with them also generally supporting the strengthening the military in the civil society - though they are not totally opposed to democracy, with Schleicher himself being known for his track record of cooperating with both progressive and conservative parties if it suited him.§!"
 GER_AFR_paternal_autocrat_party: "Notstandsregierung"
 GER_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Deutschkonservative Partei\n§gThe DkP (German Conservative Party) was founded in 1876, being extremely influential during the Bismarck era, leading the shift towards protectionism. However, after 1912 the party was unable to become the leading party of the right, which caused the formation of the DVLP, which usurped a lot of DkP members. The DkP was initially a supporter of the Ludendorff dictatorship but turned against it in the 1920s.\n\nAfter the 1923 elections, the DkP under Ernst von Heydebrand und der Lasa and Kuno Graf von Westarp reluctantly joined the Great Coalition of von Tirpitz. After the 1928 elections, Kuno von Westarp, under the pressure of the growing DVLP began the process of modernising the DkP to also attract urban right-wing voters and reform into a conservative-tent party. With it even backing an expansion of social welfare, though it also is in favour of cutting spending, except for agricultural subsidies. After the surprising death of von Tirpitz in 1930, the Kaiser picked the DkP as his successor. Following two years of uneventful rule, the German electorate voted to let them be the new administrator and keeper of its wealth. The Conservative governments have done as was demanded, and the last few years have been quiet, with as little change as possible. The party continues to support the centralisation of the Empire and strictly opposes voting reforms.§!"
 GER_national_populist_party: "DVLP"
 GER_national_populist_party_long: "Deutsche Vaterlandspartei\n§gThe DVLP (German Fatherland Party), was formed in late 1917 to represent the jingoist, anti-democratic and radical nationalist political class, with it being strongly aligned to the Alldeutscher Verband. The DVLP was the most prominent supporter of the Ludendorff dictatorship, though there were some differences in opinion over economic issues. When the Ludendorff dictatorship was removed, Alfred von Tirpitz was picked by Wilhelm as his successor, with him creating a Great Coalition of right-wing parties to solve the issues brought on by the Ludendorff dictatorship. This moderation of the party caused a lot of upset from the right-wing of the party, manifesting itself when they took over the party in the wake of the death of von Tirpitz. However, this takeover caused many supporters of the DVLP to abandon the party in favour of the DkP and DRP. The DVLP advocates for pan-Germanism, anti-parliamentarianism, anti-socialism and anti-semitism.§!"

 GER_wilhelm_iii: "Wilhelm III"
 GER_defanged_kaiser: "A Defanged Kaiser"

 GER_wilhelm_iii_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§!\nMay 6th, 1882\nMarmorpalais, Potsdam, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§W--------------§!\n§YDescription:§!\nEmperor Wilhelm III was a militarist and an autocrat from a young age. As Germany emerged victorious in the First Weltkrieg and the SPD-led coalition implemented the March Constitution for a more liberal, democratic Germany, Wilhelm was not pleased at all with the situation. The outbreak of revolutions in France, Italy and Britain proved to him that Socialism and Leftism would doom the Empire and set it on a path to ruin, and that eventually his Father and the German people would come to their senses to reject the reforms led by the Reichstag. When the Second Weltkrieg began in 1940, his fears couldn't have been proven more wrong. \n\nAs the Deutsches Heer marched into Paris once more, the popularity of the SPD and its reformist government grew and grew. By the time his Father had passed on and Wilhelm ascended to the throne, Germany was once again victorious over its rivals on the battlefield. There would be no crisis to centre the Government towards himself, nor were there any predicaments for a pretext to eject the SPD-led Reformist Government. \n\nAs the dust settles in Europe, the SPD is once again riding on the popular wave of victory to implement a true Constitutional Monarchy in Germany, robbing away the last vestiges of power from the Emperor. When the Kaiser's close aide and ideologue Kurt Von Schleicher passed away in 1946, Wilhelm has mostly resigned to his fate and has spent much of his time invested in Football instead, further investing in the German Football Association."

 GER_place_in_the_sun_desc:0 "With the Syndicalists in France, Britain and Italy along with the Savinkovists in Russia vanquished under the might of the Imperial Army, our Place in the Sun has finally been secured as the leader of all Europe. From the shores of Bordeaux to the coasts of Sevastopol, the Reichspakt stretches throughout Europe under our guardianship."
 GER_kalterkrieg:0 "The New Red Menace"
 GER_kalterkrieg_desc:0 "Although Germany has finally achieved political dominance in Europe, the same cannot be said for the other regions around the world. The victory of the Commonwealth of America in their civil war is a major political disaster for our goals and ambitions, as the American Giant prepares to once again reassert itself on the world stage. Amidst our unstable empire in Africa to the nations in Latin America, the Red Tide may soon return to these nations if we do not take caution."
 GER_second_parliamentarisation_wave:0 "The Second Parliamentarisation Wave"
 GER_second_parliamentarisation_wave_desc:0 "Following the victorious conclusion to the Second Weltkrieg, the Social Democratic Party and its coalition will aim to complete the Parliamentarisation of the German Empire by abolishing the Three-Class voting system and ensuring the Chancellor is responsible to the Reichstag rather than the Kaiser. At last, Germany will be a representative Constitutional Monarchy with liberties for all its people."
 GER_protestant_plurality:0 "A Religious Plurality"
 GER_protestant_plurality_desc:0 "As the Habsburg Empire tore itself apart with infighting in 1937, the dream of a Greater Germany was realised with the integration of the Archduchy of Austria and the German Bohemians into the Empire. Despite this glorious news, it has led to the introduction of millions of Catholic Citizens into the voting bloc, diluting the Protestant Dominance of Germany and Prussia."
 GER_reconstruction_1:0 "Reconstruction of Europe"
 GER_reconstruction_1_desc:0 "As Europe recovers from its scars of war, it is up to Germany to lead the way in its reconstruction. We will attempt to rebuild the war-torn regions of France, Britain, Italy and Eastern Europe, modernise and de-syndicalise the industries of the continent, improve prosperity and prevent the tide of socialism from re-emerging."
 GER_general_staff:0 "The Great General Staff"
 GER_general_staff_desc:0 "Our Great General Staff, established in 1814, is unparalleled in the world. Slaying the French Beasts thrice in 1871, 1919 and 1941, putting the Perfidious Albion to rest in 1943, our General Staff has been the mastermind of it all. \n\nAdditionally, the General Staff is constitutionally enshrined to be autonomous and free from political interfering by the Reichstag. Many Conservative elements in the Army, especially the Aristocratic Junker Officers, have felt that the Parliamentarisation of Germany by the SPD has gone a step too far, and they may be working behind our backs to undermine our hard-earned reforms.."

 GER_Trieste_autonomous_region: "Autonomous Free City of Trieste\n§WA byproduct of German-Italian negotiations in 1943 regarding the status of the Archduchy of Austria, Trentino and lands up to the Isonzo Line were ceded to Italy while Trieste was declared an autonomous Free City for the Italian population residing there. In exchange, Italy would be re-united under the Savoyard Monarchy once more, join the Reichspakt and permanently cease all further territorial claims on German Austria."
