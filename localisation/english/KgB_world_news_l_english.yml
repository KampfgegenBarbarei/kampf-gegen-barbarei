 worldnews.1.t:0 "Revolution in Malaya"
 worldnews.1.d:0 "Following the massacres of Socialist activists protesting for better working conditions in the Malayan plantations, the Malayan Communist Party led by Chin Peng and his allies have escaped into the jungles in order to wage a guerrilla war against Germany and their oppressive colonial rule. \n\nThe Malayan National Liberation Army, or MNLA for short, have already seized portions of Northern Malaya. Officials in Berlin have casted the blame for the revolt on external meddling from the Commonwealth of America, and have claimed that such an 'insignificant uprising' would be easily put down by the German Garrison and British Auxiliary Forces."

 worldnews.2.d:0 "As Garrisons begin to thin out in the rest of German East Asia in order to crush the revolution in Malaya, the Indochinese Communist Party led by Truong Chinh have declared a revolt of their own in Indochina in order to drive out the Germans from Asia entirely. \n\nIndochina had never been a stable colony for Germany to rule, with minor rebellions a common occurrence during the 1930s. The establishment of autonomous Kingdoms within German Indochina had barely alleviated the situation, but a full scale major revolt was prevented. It seems like that was not meant to last, as the Indochinese have risen up alongside their Malayan brothers for freedom in Asia once and for all."
